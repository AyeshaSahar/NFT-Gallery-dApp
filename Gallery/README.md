## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app to set up our React SDK.
